# React - Components and Props

### How do they work ü§î

Are you new to React and want to understand how Components and Props work? So this is the right tutorial for you!
We'll be going over all the topics from the beginning with a more profound overview of the subject.

It's been a lot to take in when we started learning React. And all the documentation we find is very confusing most of the time, right?
The most we research, the lost we get, since we have so much information nowadays.
We might assume that you already know about properties in React, but if not, no worries. Let's dive in together! üòé

## What's Props?

**React is a component-based library** that divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between components is by using props.
**‚ÄúProps‚Äù** is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.
But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a **uni-directional flow**. (one way from parent to child)
Furthermore, **props data is read-only**, which means that data coming from the parent **should not be** changed by child components.
OK now let‚Äôs see how to use Props with an example‚Ä¶
